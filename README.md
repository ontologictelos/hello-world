#### A being seeking means to his own Ontology
Going to college for the first time I studied _Studio Art, Philosophy, and Theology_. 
> While this satisfied my thoughts on what a human should be acending to these studies fed my mind and soul but not my body. Thus the thought came to mind of how am I going to pay for and feed myself.  
> 
Acertaining this thought I quickly dropped out and persued a place in the coffee world. Learning to create and perfect my craft of Traditonal Esspresso drinks. For a time this fed mind, body and soul but this was not to last.Once my student loans came due, my meager barista paycheck could not sadate the hunger of the american financial system. Thus I joined the Air Force and am now persuing a Computer Science degree to pay the system as not to be bothered by money ever again to be bothered in my persuit of becoming more human.
